# ðŸ—³ *The Big Election Studies Spreadsheet!* ðŸ“Š

This repository contains a spreadsheet of all known election studies and where to find them. For now, it focusses only on those election studies that use some version of "gold standard" random probability sampling, but I'm not averse to amending that in the future.

My process here has been to start with the CSES, then to overwrite any election studies that appear in the CSES but also have larger independent files. So far it includes information on election studies hosted by:

- [The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems](https://cses.org)
- [The American National Election Studies](http://electionstudies.org)

Undoubtedly, there will be some cases that I have missed. This is most likely true for the very earliest election studies. If you know of any data sets that I have missed, feel free to open an issue, to contact me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/PoliSciJack), or to send me an [email](mailto:jack.bailey@manchester.ac.uk).
