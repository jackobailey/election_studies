# Election Studies Spreadsheet

This spreadsheet contains a list of all available election studies and where to find them. For now, it focusses only on those election studies that use some version of "gold standard" random probability sampling.

Undoubtedly, there will be some cases that I have missed. This is most likely true for the very earliest election studies. If you know of any data sets that I have missed, feel free to open an issue, to contact me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/PoliSciJack), or to send me an [email](mailto:jack.bailey@manchester.ac.uk).
